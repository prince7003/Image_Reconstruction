# Image_Reconstruction


This project focuses on the application of Linear Regression and Random Fourier Features for Image Reconstruction.

## Linear Regression

Linear Regression is a statistical method that allows us to summarize and study relationships between two continuous (quantitative) variables. In the context of image reconstruction, we use linear regression to predict pixel values based on their relationship with other pixels in the image.

## Random Fourier Features

Random Fourier Features (RFF) is a method used to approximate the Gaussian kernel in a computationally efficient manner. It allows us to transform the data into a higher dimensional space where it becomes linearly separable. In the context of image reconstruction, RFF can be used to capture complex patterns and structures in the image data, which can then be used to reconstruct the image.

The combination of Linear Regression and Random Fourier Features provides a powerful tool for image reconstruction, capable of capturing both linear relationships and complex patterns in the image data.
